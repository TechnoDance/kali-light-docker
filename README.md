# kali-light-docker

It provides a Kali Linux light container with essential packages ready to work! You can add your own packages via Dockerfile and re-build it. 

# Usage:

Just launch the container using our simple bash compose handler:

bash run.sh

This will prepare a temporal container (will be auto-destroyed at the end) with the latest available version of Kali
